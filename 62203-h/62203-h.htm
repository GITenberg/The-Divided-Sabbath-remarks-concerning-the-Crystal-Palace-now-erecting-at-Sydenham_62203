DIVIDED SABBATH,<br />
&amp;c. &amp;c.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Report, found in the
<i>Times</i> of August 2d, 1852, appears to be, on one side at
least, demi-official.&nbsp; It has given occasion to the Remarks
contained in this pamphlet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are happy to be able to state, that so
far as the Government are concerned, no impediment will be thrown
in the way, and that there is now no fear of the people&rsquo;s
losing their palace on the day on which they can best avail
themselves of its many means of elevation and refinement.&nbsp;
When the Directors of the Crystal Palace Company applied some few
weeks since to Lord Derby for a Charter, they communicated to his
Lordship the terms upon which they proposed to open the building
and grounds on Sundays.&nbsp; They were of opinion, that until
after one o&rsquo;clock no trains should run from London, and the
Crystal Palace itself should be strictly closed.&nbsp; After that
hour they <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>proposed to throw open the Park and the Winter-Garden,
but not to exhibit those departments of the building, which will
partake exclusively of a manufacturing and commercial character,
the intention being to devote a certain portion of the space to
specimens of manufactures, &amp;c., which the public will be
invited, upon certain conditions, to display.&nbsp; In the third
place, the Directors undertook that on Sunday no spirituous
liquors should be sold in their grounds.&nbsp; On Monday last
Lord Derby requested an interview with the Directors, who, with
Sir J. Paxton, waited upon the Premier and the Home Secretary in
Downing Street.&nbsp; At this meeting his Lordship acquiesced in
the stipulations proffered by the Crystal Palace Company,
suggested a few trifling variations, and promised to grant the
required Charter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An article in the <i>Times</i>, four days later, Aug. 6th,
gives a full account of the ceremony of erecting the first column
of the New Crystal Palace.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With every desire that the best interests of my Countrymen
should be promoted, and with sincere respect for those who
entertain a similar wish, I have <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>felt it my duty as an Englishman, and
still more as a Clergyman, to submit the following considerations
to my Queen and my Country.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Crystal Palace now erecting at Sydenham is designed to be
the most splendid display of national greatness in the
earth.&nbsp; No objection can exist to its grandeur, its beauty,
the marvellous exotics to be exhibited in it, or to the display
of ingenious manufactures.&nbsp; Some things it is intended to
expose, which may prove decidedly objectionable: I refer to the
sculpture-department.&nbsp; But I will not enter into
details.&nbsp; The one great evil characterising the plan, is
this&mdash;That it is designed to open the building to visitors
during one half of the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Observe&mdash;the people of London and its suburbs, that is,
four millions, are invited to mutilate the Sabbath, by a plan
which allows the first half to be given to God&rsquo;s worship,
but allures them to spend the second half in worldly
amusement.&nbsp; The favourers of the scheme virtually
say&mdash;&ldquo;Resort to the House of God in the morning, and
to the Temple of Pleasure the rest of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is a scheme far more artful, than if the enemy of mankind had
said, &ldquo;Give <i>the whole day</i> to me:&rdquo; that would
have shocked us at once: but&mdash;&ldquo;Let half be given to
God, and the second half <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>to Pleasure&rdquo;&mdash;this is
plausible: and it is therefore so much the more dangerous.</p>
<p>I have said, four millions are thus invited.&nbsp; But
consider the Counties involved in this invitation&mdash;the many
watering-places in those counties, which have Excursion-trains in
connection with London the whole of Sunday&mdash;the near
neighbourhood of France and other Continental countries&mdash;the
habits of those countries in making Sunday an open day for every
kind of diversion.&nbsp; Taking all these points into
consideration, there is something more to be contemplated, than
the mere erection of a Crystal Palace.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let us reflect how the plan will work.&nbsp; I have used a
decent term, &ldquo;Pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the favourers of
the scheme may adopt terms yet more reputable: inviting people to
the study of Nature, in all the wonderful productions of native
and foreign plants, leading them &ldquo;from Nature up to
Nature&rsquo;s God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sounds well: but after all,
the thing is, not what an elegant writer may describe it, but
what the Million will make it.&nbsp; A poet, or an artist, may
disguise a subject in a thousand ways: but this Temple of
Pleasure will infallibly become, in the hands of the Million, a
Focus of Dissipation.</p>
<p>Analyse a little this divided Sabbath, this Lord&rsquo;s Day
divided into two halves: not indeed perfectly equal halves; for
the nominal date of recreation commences precisely one hour after
mid-day: then the rush of railway <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>carriages from the London terminus is
to commence, Divine Service having at most Churches in and about
London ended at one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then, and in the hours
following, the twenty, or the fifty thousand men, women and
children, are to be set in motion.&nbsp; They will find no
intoxicating drinks sold on the premises of the Crystal
Palace!&nbsp; But will not the surrounding localities offer them,
under the name of refreshments, whatever they please?</p>
<p>Look to the first part of the day.&nbsp; Does any man suppose
that one half of these many thousands will have been worshipping
God in the family and in the Church?&nbsp; Is it in the least
degree likely?&nbsp; Does a single favourer of the scheme imagine
it probable?&nbsp; I think not.</p>
<p>But then it will be pleaded, that the scheme is purposely so
arranged, that people <i>might</i>, if they wished, go to Church
with their families in the forenoon.&nbsp; I have even heard it
gravely said, &ldquo;The people <i>need not</i> break the
Sabbath: they <i>may</i> go to Church in the morning; and if they
do not, it is their own fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this argument
silence might be the best reply.&nbsp; And I hope truly, that the
<i>Conscience of the Nation</i> will repudiate such
sophistry.</p>
<p>I speak of Conscience: and I remember that the conscience of a
Child is as much honoured and protected by God, as the conscience
of any other individual.&nbsp; <i>Take heed that ye offend not
one of these little ones</i>.&nbsp; Better for a man to have a
millstone hanged about his neck, and he be cast into the sea,
than that the moral sense <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of a young person be perverted.&nbsp;
Suppose, now, a father or mother to take some of their children
to Church, and hear the Commandments read: then imagine an
ingenuous boy or girl, on the way to the Crystal Palace, saying,
&ldquo;The Minister read the words, <i>Remember that thou keep
holy the Sabbath-day</i>;&rdquo; and they ask father or mother to
reconcile the words of the command, and their excursion of
amusement: the parents hush up the matter, by saying,
&ldquo;Children must not be particular; it is enough to keep holy
<i>half the Sabbath Day</i>, and spend the rest of it
pleasantly.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a comment would this be!</p>
<p>This then is the sin, the one sin, at which I take aim.&nbsp;
I do not pursue this part of the subject, by showing what
multitudes of Railway servants, Publicans, Policemen, and others,
will inevitably be absorbed during the entire Sabbath for miles
and miles around, by this scheme.&nbsp; Here is the one crime, a
divided Sabbath: here is the focus and centre of it, the Crystal
Palace at Sydenham!&mdash;If any do not see the evil, or are
determined to blink it, it will not be difficult to draw up a
Sketch (not an exaggerated Sketch, but a very simple one, and so
much the more convincing:) taking into view&mdash;1.&nbsp; London
and its suburbs: 2.&nbsp; The circumjacent Counties: 3.&nbsp; The
infection of the Continental Sabbath: 4.&nbsp; The state of the
families of the industrial classes during the six week-days: and,
5.&nbsp; Their probable condition from Saturday Evening to Monday
Evening, <i>forty-eight hours</i>, resulting from this scheme of
a <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Divided
Sabbath.&nbsp; But I hope that no such Tract will ever have to be
written.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The projected <i>Aggression of Pleasure</i> in 1853 is to me a
greater object of dread, than the <i>Aggression of Popery</i> in
1850: because it falls in with the taste of the vast majority of
mankind.&nbsp; The danger of Popery I do not
under-estimate.&nbsp; It is a scheme adapted to fall in with the
Formalism and Self-Righteousness of Man&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
There was also treachery in the camp of the Church of England, at
the time when Popery took aim at the Royal Supremacy, and
asserted its claim to be Lord of the consciences of all mankind:
England, of course, included.&nbsp; But England repelled that
aggression.&nbsp; The <i>Aggression of Pleasure</i> is more
subtle, more extensive, more congenial.&nbsp; It is a subject,
therefore, on which I must expatiate with the honest and
affectionate freedom of a Clergyman.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let me then observe, first, that it is a very difficult task
<i>To move great masses of people in a right direction</i>.&nbsp;
In a wrong direction, it is not so difficult.&nbsp; To rouse them
to revolution, and then screw them down by despotism, has been
the work of a short time, in some neighbouring countries.&nbsp;
But to draw them back from an evil purpose, and lead them into a
right channel of feeling and action, is a hard work:&mdash;a
consideration this, which makes it the more imperative to check
at <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>once
this flagrant scheme of Sabbath-breaking before it begins.&nbsp;
Once broken out, what human hand can turn back the torrent?</p>
<p>But is it not equally difficult <i>Rightly to move the heart
even of one individual</i>?&nbsp; We speak of &ldquo;The
Million:&rdquo; but that million is composed of units.&nbsp; To
lead any one individual, be he rich or poor, to feel the value of
his own soul, is a work worthy the labours and sacrifices of a
whole life.&nbsp; To move that one heart, however, is not
man&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; <i>With man this is impossible</i>:
<i>but with God all things are possible</i>.</p>
<p>Hence appears the importance of the <i>Prayer of
faith</i>.&nbsp; Christ is the Strong One, stronger than Satan,
in whose name prayer is to be offered to the Father: and in
answer to believing prayer, the Holy Spirit is poured forth, on
individuals, on Churches, on Nations, on the whole World.&nbsp;
Who can overpower the Almighty Spirit, when it pleases Him to
work?&nbsp; Without his influence, nothing, even under the most
favourable circumstances, can be effected: with His influence,
every good work, under most unfavourable circumstances, may and
will be effected.&nbsp; <i>Not by power</i>, <i>not by might</i>,
<i>but by my Spirit</i>, <i>saith the Lord of Hosts</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Who art thou</i>, <i>O great mountain</i>! <i>before
Zerubbabel</i>, <i>thou shalt become a plain</i>.&nbsp; By the
power of the Spirit, every difficulty presented by the Million
shall vanish.&nbsp; The heart of the Million shall be bowed, as
the heart of one man.&nbsp; This will be in answer to prayer;
whether secret prayer; or both secret and social prayer.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Another
consideration deeply affecting to my mind, is this.&nbsp; Among
the various means for the promotion and preservation of a
nation&rsquo;s welfare, there is not one of higher importance
than the exercise of <i>A faithful Gospel-Ministry</i>.&nbsp; I
am, on principle, a Clergyman of the Church of England: but I
honour Ministers of every Communion, who with simplicity and
godly sincerity preach Christ.&nbsp; In the present eventful
crisis, we need the aid of all.&nbsp; Here is no question of
Church and Dissent: the question is, whether or not Popery and
Pleasure shall over-run the land&mdash;whether we shall uphold
the Law of God, and Christ&rsquo;s Gospel; or violate both.</p>
<p>There is a great Duty now lying before us: namely&mdash;<i>To
make the Lord&rsquo;s Day profitable and interesting to the
People</i>.&nbsp; By the Crystal Palace scheme the People are
invited to Pleasure: at least for the second half of the
day.&nbsp; The favourers of this scheme expressly undertake to
teach the People &ldquo;to amuse themselves:&rdquo; and Sunday,
from one o&rsquo;clock till night-fall, is selected for the
purpose of promoting this object among the working classes.&nbsp;
As Ministers of Christ, then, are we not now brought to the
test?&nbsp; &ldquo;Will we endeavour to make the Lord&rsquo;s
Day&mdash;the whole of it&mdash;interesting and useful to the
Million?&nbsp; How likewise may we put the people into the way of
making this day interesting to themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel the difficulties of this part of the subject: nor can I
remove them by proposing so many more Sermons, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Services,
Sabbath-Schools, &amp;c., although works of such kind would
naturally form a part of any plan of extending usefulness.&nbsp;
But I feel, and long have felt that there is one great, vital
measure; which, if God should bless us in the universal promotion
of that measure, will diffuse spiritual health and happiness
through all classes of society.</p>
<p>To render the Lord&rsquo;s Day interesting, Religion itself
must become interesting to a People.&nbsp; Every-day Religion is
the only thing that can make a Sunday-Religion profitable and
interesting.&nbsp; The one topic of pre-eminent importance in
this point of view is&mdash;<i>The General introduction of Family
Prayer</i>.&nbsp; Domestic Worship is among the greatest of
earthly blessings, both to the Rich and to the Poor.&nbsp; We say
in England, &ldquo;Every man&rsquo;s house is his
Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; For all domestic purposes, let every
man&rsquo;s house be also his Church!&nbsp; In setting up this
standard, the Ministers of Christ have a noble task before
them.&nbsp; Our public Congregations on the Lord&rsquo;s Day will
not be diminished by the multiplication of these Domestic
Sanctuaries during the week: these, on the contrary, will render
our every-day Religion interesting, and thus make also the
Sabbath a delight.&nbsp; They will fill our Churches, and thin
the throng of Sabbath-breakers, please God, to nothing!</p>
<p>As to the notion that this violation of the Sabbath will give
rest and mental refinement to the people, it is an utter
delusion.&nbsp; Last year I was conversing about the
Excursion-trains with an aged relative, who has <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>since been
removed to the eternal world.&nbsp; When under twenty years of
age he was for a while engaged in mercantile business, in one of
the most active and opulent of our manufacturing towns: but from
pure love to the work of the Ministry he relinquished very
flattering worldly prospects, and for more than forty years was a
burning and a shining light in the parish and in the county where
he laboured.&nbsp; Referring to his early days, and viewing with
alarm the threatening abuses of the Railways, he remarked to
me&mdash;&ldquo;They quite mistake the idea of Sunday-rest, who
suppose that it consists in pleasure-taking.&nbsp; When I was
engaged in business, early and late on all the
week-days&mdash;very often so tired out that I scarcely knew what
to do with myself&mdash;Sunday was the greatest possible
refreshment to me.&nbsp; The mere act of ceasing from work,
together with reading my Bible and going to Church, was
rest.&nbsp; But then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this implies a
change of heart; a different taste from what the world
has.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have thus written from the fulness of my heart, and from the
deepest convictions of my judgment, believing that a crisis of
great danger to our beloved country is closely impending.&nbsp;
If a Royal Charter has been promised, specifically authorising
the opening of the Crystal Palace on any part of Sunday, then the
Poor are in the fair way to be robbed of their real Rest, by the
substitution of an imaginary recreation, so arranged that it
cannot be <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>enjoyed without sin.&nbsp; If the Royal sanction were
actually given, I would yet look to &ldquo;The Million,&rdquo;
Englishmen as they are, and Bible-men, to reject the proffered
amusement.&nbsp; How may the threatened evil be averted?&nbsp;
Whether deliverance shall be sent from some very humble quarter;
or whether it shall be the hand of a Queen, more wary than
Darius, that shall refuse to sign the writing and the decree, God
alone knoweth!&nbsp; My earnest hope and prayer, is, that the
rumour of such a Charter may die away to nothing.&nbsp; As
Englishmen, may we be roused from our dreams of amusement to a
higher standard of duty!&nbsp; May History never have to record,
that in the nineteenth century it was sought to erect&mdash;and
in Britain, too&mdash;a People&rsquo;s happiness on the basis of
God&rsquo;s broken law!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
